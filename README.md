# NY Academy of Science Program

This repo is used to present the work covered in the NY Academy of Science Program that pairs a teacher with a Scientist-in-Residence to introduce students to science. In this program, students were introduced to Python, worked on the Billion Oyster Data and Air Quality Data collected at their schools, and presented their work.
